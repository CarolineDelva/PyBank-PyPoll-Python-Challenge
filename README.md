#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## PyBank
### Project Description
The purpose of this project is to analyze the financial data from the [budget_data.csv](https://github.com/CarolineDelva/PyBank-PyPoll-Python-Challenge/blob/master/Resources/budget_data.csv) of a fictitious company to extract the following information:

* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

### Method Used
* Data Analysis


### Techonologies 
* Python (os, csv)


## Needs of this project
- data exploration
- descriptive analysis


## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. CSV can be found in the [Resources](https://github.com/CarolineDelva/PyBank-PyPoll-Python-Challenge/tree/master/Resources) in this repository.
    
3. The Python script is located in the [PyBank](https://github.com/CarolineDelva/PyBank-PyPoll-Python-Challenge/blob/master/PyBank/main2.py) folder.
4. Run the script in a code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Output 
```
Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $38382578
Average  Change: $-2315.12
Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
```



## PyPoll
### Project Description
The purpose of this project is to modernize the vote-counting process at a small rural town. The project contains a python script compute the following election result from the [election_data.csv](https://github.com/CarolineDelva/PyBank-PyPoll-Python-Challenge/blob/master/Resources/election_data.csv). 

* The total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote

The script export the election result into a [text file](https://github.com/CarolineDelva/PyBank-PyPoll-Python-Challenge/blob/master/PyPoll/output.txt) for the town's mayor to publish.

### Method Used
