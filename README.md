#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## PyBank
### Project Description
The purpose of this project is to analyze the financial data from the [budget_data.csv](https://github.com/CarolineDelva/PyBank-PyPoll-Python-Challenge/blob/master/Resources/budget_data.csv) of a fictitious company to extract the following information:

* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

### Method Used
* Data Analysis


### Techonologies 
* Python (os, csv)


## Needs of this project
- data exploration
- descriptive statistics


## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
